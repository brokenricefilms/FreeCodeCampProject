            This is the documentation for fish, the friendly interactive shell.
          </p>
          <p>
            A shell is a program which helps you operate your computer by
            starting other programs. fish offers a command-line interface
            focused on usability and interactive use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other shells, fish does not follow the POSIX standard, but
            still roughly belongs to the same family.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the special features of fish are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extensive UI: syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, tab completion
              and selection lists that can be navigated and filtered.
            </li>
            <li>
              No configuration needed: fish is designed to be ready to use
              immediately, without requiring extensive configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy scripting: new functions can be added on the fly. The syntax
              is easy to learn and use.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This bit of the documentation is a quick guide on how to get going.
            If you are new to this, see the tutorial.

            Once fish has been installed, open a terminal. If fish is not the
            default shell:
          </p>
          <li>Enter fish to start a fish shell:</li>
          <code> > fish </code>
          <li>Enter exit to exit a fish shell:</li>

            If fish is your default shell and you want to copy commands from the
            internet that are written in a different shell language, bash for
            example, you can proceed in the following way:
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider, that bash is also a command. With man bash you can see
            that there are two ways to do this:
          </p>

          <li>bash has a switch -c to read from a string:</li>

          <code> > bash -c SomeBashCommand </code>
          <p>
            or bash without a switch, opens a bash shell that you can use and
            exit afterwards.

        <article>
          <p>
            You can make fish your default shell by adding fish's executable in
            two places: - add <mark>/usr/local/bin/fish to /etc/shells</mark> -
            change your default shell with <mark>chsh -s</mark> to
            <mark>/usr/local/bin/fish</mark>

          <p>
            Since scripts for shell commands can be written in many different
            languages, they need to carry information about what interpreter is
            needed to execute them: For this they are expected to have a first
            line, the shebang line, which names an executable for this purpose:
          </p>

          <p>Example:</p>

          <p>A scripts written in bash it would need a first line like this:</p>

          <code> #!/bin/bash </code>
          <p>
            This line tells the shell to execute the file with the bash
            interpreter, that is located at the path <mark>/bin/bash</mark>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a script, written in another language, just replace the
            interpreter <mark>/bin/bash</mark> with the language interpreter of
            that other language (for example <mark>/bin/python</mark> for a
            <mark>python</mark> script)
          </p>
          <p>
            This line is only needed when scripts are executed without
            specifying the interpreter. For functions inside fish or when
            executing a script with <mark>`fish /path/to/script</mark> they
            aren't required (but don't hurt either!).

            Shells like fish are used by giving them commands. Every fish
            command follows the same basic syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            A command is executed by writing the name of the command followed by
            any arguments.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>

          <code> echo hello world </code>
          <p>
            This calls the <mark>echo</mark> command. <mark>echo</mark> is a
            command which will write its arguments to the screen. In the example
            above, the output will be 'hello world'. Everything in fish is done
            with commands. There are commands for performing a set of commands
            multiple times, commands for assigning variables, commands for
            treating a group of commands as a single command, etc.. And every
            single command follows the same basic syntax.
          </p>
          If you want to find out more about the <mark>echo</mark> command used
          above, read the manual page for the <mark>echo</mark> command by
          writing: <mark>man echo</mark>
          <p>
            <mark>man</mark> is a command for displaying a manual page on a
            given topic. The man command takes the name of the manual page to
            display as an argument. There are manual pages for almost every
            command on most computers. There are also manual pages for many
            other things, such as system libraries and important files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every program on your computer can be used as a command in
            <mark>fish</mark>. If the program file is located in one of the
            directories in the PATH, you can just use the name of the program to
            use it. Otherwise the whole filename, including the directory (like
            <mark>/home/me/code/checkers/checkers</mark> or
            <mark>../checkers</mark>) has to be used.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a list of some useful commands:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark>cd</mark>, change the current directory</li>
            <li><mark>ls</mark>, list files and directories</li>
            <li><mark>man </mark>, display a manual page on the screen</li>
            <li><mark>mv</mark>, move (rename) files</li>
            <li><mark>cp</mark>, copy files</li>
            <li>
              <mark>open</mark>, open files with the default application
              associated with each filetype
            </li>
            <li><mark>less</mark>, list the contents of files</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Commands and parameters are separated by the space character ' '.
            Every command ends with either a newline (i.e. by pressing the
            return key) or a semicolon '<mark>;</mark>'. More than one command
            can be written on the same line by separating them with semicolons.
          </p>
          <p>
            A switch is a very common special type of argument. Switches almost
            always start with one or more hyphens '<mark>-</mark>' and alter the
            way a command operates. For example, the '<mark>ls</mark>' command
            usually lists all the files and directories in the current working
            directory, but by using the '<mark>-l</mark>' switch, the behavior
            of '<mark>ls</mark>' is changed to not only display the filename,
            but also the size, permissions, owner and modification time of each
            file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Switches differ between commands and are documented in the manual
            page for each command. Some switches are common to most command
            though, for example '<mark>--help</mark>' will usually display a
            help text, '<mark>-i</mark>' will often turn on interactive
            prompting before taking action, while '<mark>-f</mark>' will turn it
            off.

          <p>
            This is a short explanation of some of the commonly used words in
            fish.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>argument</strong> a parameter given to a command</li>
            <li>
              <strong>builtin</strong> a command that is implemented in the
              shell. Builtins are commands that are so closely tied to the shell
              that it is impossible to implement them as external commands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>command</strong> a program that the shell can run. In
              another sense also specifically an external command (i.e. neither
              a function or builtin).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>function</strong> a block of commands that can be called
              as if mmand. By using functions, it is possible to string toget
              they were a single command. By using functions, it is possible to
              string together multiple smaller commands into one more advanced
              command.
            </li>
            <li><strong>job</strong> a running pipeline or command</li>
            <li>
              pipeline a set of commands stringed together so that the output of
              one command is the input of the next command
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>redirection</strong> an operation that changes one of the
              input/output streams associated with a job
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>switch</strong> a special flag sent as an argument to a
              command that will alter the behavior of the command. A switch
              almost always begins with one or two hyphens.
            </li>
